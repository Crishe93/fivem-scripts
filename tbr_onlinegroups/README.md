## Instructions
This scripts depends on [pNotify](https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-pnotify-in-game-js-notifications-using-noty/20659) and [vRP](https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-vrp-framework/22894).
Copy the correct version of the resource into your resources folder and start it into your server config file.  
~~The vrp1 version has not been tested, but if it doesn't work it should be very easy to fix.~~ (apparently it's all fine)   
Feel free to post an issue if there is any problem. 
  
  
## Todo
- [ ] Add a `_config` property to the labels where we can set a specific color for that specific label. So you can set all the factions as red, police and emergency groups as blue and so on.
